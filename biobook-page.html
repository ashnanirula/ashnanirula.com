        <p>While going for a hike in my local area with a friend, I came across a beautiful floral plant. It was a shrub of some sort with bright, small fuschia flowers. Naturally, wanting to seem like a plant genius I wanted to be able to name it's genus and species. I wanted to be able to photograph the image, and then quickly save a bunch of useful information.
        </p>
        <p>Even with tools like Google Lens, it felt like there wasn't a clear place I could store all my newfound plant knowledge. That was why I decided to build BioBook, a digital field guide with AI Image recognition and customized lists to collect plants in your local area!</p>
        <p>The project is still in the works, but to visualize how it would look and feel I created a simple Figma wireframe design. This wireframe demo shows what a custom list would look like for a user of the platform adding in the tartarian honeysuckle I had seen.</p>
